+ IMPORTANT!!!
- modify rights for folder /uploads/photos/grad_photo/ to CHMOD 777

FIRST THING YOU NEED TO DO!
YOU MUST SELECT CATEGORIES OR NO CATEGORIES IN THE PREFERENCES SECTION (only yes works right now).

Install like normal, go to admin section, set PREFERENCES, then you MUST add a Category or a School first.

You MUST go to permissions in Alumni admin and give permissions to the appropriate groups.

Add Alumni through the user section.

You can now set max-width and max-height along with max file size in preferences.


TO DO:

* Have not updated the waiting plugin
* Notifications don't work because a regular user can not access that area, so I can't test it.
* Will only work with the 'use_categories' config option set to yes, I haven't gone through it and added that, wondering if I need that..
* Deal with pictures better.
